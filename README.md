# stackvm
A stack based virtual machine that is inspired by the text "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools". 
The functionality from the machine specified in book has been extended to include things such as printing.

Code to run on this machine can be generated by this [compiler](https://github.com/Mark-Powers/ccompiler).
